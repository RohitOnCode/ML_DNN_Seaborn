What is a Deep Neural Network (DNN)?
A deep neural network (DNN) is an advanced type of artificial neural network (ANN) that comprises multiple hidden layers. Unlike simple ANNs, DNNs can handle intricate problems by adding depth to the network architecture. These additional layers allow DNNs to learn complex patterns and achieve high accuracy in various domains.

Here are some key points about DNNs:

Structure: DNNs consist of input layers, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer.
Applications: They excel in computer vision, natural language processing, and transfer learning.
Examples: Notable DNN models include YOLO (object detection), BERT (language translation), and VGG-19 (image processing) 1.
